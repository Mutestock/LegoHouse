## LegoHouse

This is a solution to a mandatory educational project. 

IMPORTANT:

Due to the recent confusion about the deadline of this project, I've made an edition of it which assumes that the deadline is 25/05/19 23:55 instead of 24/05/19 23:55.

This version is designated as: legohouseDeadline25th

If the deadline was, in fact, NOT the 25th and instead the 24th, then please use the standard folder, which was last updated on the 24th deadline. Look at the commit log if in doubt.


Changes made in the 25th edition are:

* Inclusion and usage of custom exceptions
* Correcting errors
* Attempts at increasing program performance
* Improving code readability
* Comments
* Update facade
* A few other nitpicky things.
